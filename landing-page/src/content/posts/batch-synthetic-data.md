# Generating Synthetic Data at Scale Using Batch LLMs

Have you noticed how quickly expenses balloon when relying solely on large, off-the-shelf language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude? Running inference with these models is convenient, but the hidden costs can quickly stack up, especially at scale. Imagine generating customer insights or synthetic financial data daily for millions of transactions—your bills could spiral out of control, rapidly eroding profit margins. It's clear: the time to optimize these costs is now.

## Why Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data, artificially generated by AI models, mimics real-world data without exposing sensitive or proprietary information. It has become essential in scenarios like privacy-preserving data sharing, training machine learning models, and enhancing AI-driven decision-making processes. But how can you generate synthetic data cost-effectively at scale? The answer: leveraging batch processing with large language models.

## Batch Processing: Your Cost-Effective Ally

Batch processing with LLMs dramatically reduces operational expenses compared to on-demand inference. Let's consider two scenarios for generating synthetic financial transaction data:

- On-demand Generation (GPT-4): Costs approximately $4,000 per 1 million data points.
- Batch Processing (Exosphere): Costs approximately $1,000 per 1 million data points.

That's a massive 75% cost reduction! Batch processing consolidates requests, optimizes resource usage, and executes workloads efficiently during off-peak hours or via optimized scheduling, significantly cutting infrastructure expenses.

## The Power of Fine-tuning with Synthetic Data

Once you've efficiently generated synthetic data through batch LLMs, the next step is fine-tuning smaller models. Here's where things get truly exciting:

Fine-tuning involves training smaller, specialized models using outputs from larger models. This approach allows you to leverage the intelligence and accuracy of powerful models like GPT-4 but at a fraction of the cost and latency.

## Diffusion and Its Role in Fine-tuning

Diffusion techniques—popularized in generative AI for image generation—can also enhance text data generation. Diffusion works by iteratively refining outputs, improving their accuracy and realism over multiple steps. Applied to text, diffusion ensures that synthetic data closely matches complex distributions found in real datasets.

By incorporating diffusion methods:

- You achieve higher-quality synthetic datasets.
- Smaller models fine-tuned on these datasets reach impressive accuracy and nuanced understanding.

## Real-world Benefits: Companies That Can Thrive

Consider financial technology companies like Robinhood or Stripe:

- **Robinhood** could use batch-generated synthetic financial data to train fraud detection algorithms, substantially reducing their reliance on costly real-time inference.
- **Stripe** might leverage synthetic transaction data to enhance their models for transaction prediction and risk assessment, drastically cutting inference costs while maintaining high accuracy.

Healthcare tech firms like Teladoc Health could similarly generate synthetic patient data to train diagnostic models without compromising patient privacy.

## Cost Comparison: Fine-tuned Smaller Models vs. Original Large Models

Here's another compelling cost analysis:

- Original Large Model (GPT-4): Monthly inference costs are approximately $10,000
- Fine-tuned Smaller Model: Monthly inference costs are approximately $2,500

This represents a 75% reduction, driven by optimized infrastructure, efficient batch processing, and significantly reduced computational demands.
