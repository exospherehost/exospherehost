We should just focus on building great products and services, and not worry about the infrastructure that powers them. We also believe that future is of our systems working in the background for us and solving critical problems requiring huge computational power and infrastructure requirements.

Hence we are building an open-source infrastructure layer for background AI workflows/agents that is reliable, affordable, and effortless.
