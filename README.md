## ⏰ Automatic Scheduling Example

Schedule your workflows to run automatically using cron expressions:

!!! info "Beta Feature"
    Available in `beta-latest` Docker tag and SDK version `0.0.3b1`

```python
from exospherehost import StateManager, GraphNodeModel, CronTrigger

# Define triggers for automatic execution
triggers = [
    CronTrigger(expression="0 9 * * 1-5"),  # Every weekday at 9 AM
    CronTrigger(expression="0 */6 * * *")   # Every 6 hours
]

# Create graph with automatic scheduling
result = await state_manager.upsert_graph(
    graph_name="data-pipeline",
    graph_nodes=graph_nodes,
    secrets={"api_key": "your-key"},
    triggers=triggers  # Enable automatic execution (Beta)
)
```

### **Deployment Options**

- **Local Development**: Run with Docker Compose for quick setup
- **Kubernetes**: Production-ready deployment on K8s clusters
- **Cloud**: Deploy on any cloud provider with Kubernetes support

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

### Step 1: Installation

```bash
uv add exospherehost
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Node
   
   Each node is an atomic, reusable unit in Exosphere. Once registered, you can plug it into any workflow. Nodes can be AI agents, API calls, data processors, or any custom logic you want to execute.
   
   ```python
   from exospherehost import BaseNode
   from pydantic import BaseModel

   class CityAnalyzerNode(BaseNode):
       """A node that analyzes and describes a city using AI"""
       
       class Inputs(BaseModel):
           city: str
           analysis_type: str = "general"  # general, tourism, business, etc.

       class Outputs(BaseModel):
           description: str
           key_features: str
           score: str

       class Secrets(BaseModel):
           openai_api_key: str  # Optional: for AI-powered analysis

       async def execute(self) -> Outputs:
           # Your custom logic here - could be:
           # - AI agent calls
           # - API requests
           # - Data processing
           # - Database queries
           # - Any Python code!
           
           description = f"Analysis of {self.inputs.city}"
           features = ["culture", "economy", "lifestyle"]
           score = 8.5
           
           return self.Outputs(
               description=description,
               key_features=json.dumps(features),
               score=str(score)
           )
   ```

 

### Step 3: Create and Start the Runtime

Create the runtime and register your nodes:
  ```python
  from exospherehost import Runtime

  # Initialize the runtime with your nodes
  runtime = Runtime(
      name="city-analysis-runtime",
      namespace="my-project",
      nodes=[CityAnalyzerNode]
  )

  # Start the runtime (this will block the main thread)
  runtime.start()
  ```

  **Run your application:**
  ```bash
  uv run main.py
  ```

  Your runtime is now running and ready to process workflows! 🎉

### Step 4: Define Your First Graph
  
  Graphs can be defined using JSON objects or with the new model-based Python SDK (beta) for better type safety and validation. See [Graph definitions](https://docs.exosphere.host/exosphere/create-graph/) for more examples.



  ```python
  from exospherehost import StateManager, GraphNodeModel, RetryPolicyModel, RetryStrategyEnum

  async def create_graph():
      state_manager = StateManager(namespace="hello-world")
      
      graph_nodes = [
          GraphNodeModel(
              node_name="MyFirstNode",
              namespace="hello-world", 
              identifier="describe_city",
              inputs={"city": "initial"},
              next_nodes=[]
          )
      ]
      
      # Optional: Define retry policy (beta)
      retry_policy = RetryPolicyModel(
          max_retries=3,
          strategy=RetryStrategyEnum.EXPONENTIAL,
          backoff_factor=2000
      )
      
      # Create graph with model-based approach (beta)
      result = await state_manager.upsert_graph(
          graph_name="my-first-graph",
          graph_nodes=graph_nodes,
          secrets={},
          retry_policy=retry_policy  # beta
      )
  ```

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

Get Exosphere running locally in under 2 minutes:

### 1. Set up environment variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate secure secrets (REQUIRED!)
# For STATE_MANAGER_SECRET and EXOSPHERE_API_KEY:
openssl rand -base64 32

# For SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY (must be a valid Fernet key):
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"

# Edit .env and add your generated secrets
nano .env
```

> **🔒 Security Note**: Never commit `.env` file or use default secrets in production! See [SECURITY_SETUP.md](SECURITY_SETUP.md) for detailed security configuration.

### 2. Start the services

```bash
# Option 1: With cloud MongoDB (recommended)
# Ensure MONGO_URI is set in your .env file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exospherehost/exospherehost/main/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d

# Option 2: With local MongoDB (development)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exospherehost/exospherehost/main/docker-compose/docker-compose-with-mongodb.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-mongodb.yml up -d
```

**Environment Configuration:**
- Docker Compose automatically loads `.env` files from the working directory
- All secrets must be configured before starting services
- Use `.env.example` as a template - never commit `.env` to version control

Access your services:

- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **API**: `http://localhost:8000`

> **📝 Note**: This configuration requires proper environment setup. For production deployments, environment variable customization, and advanced configuration options, please read the complete **[Docker Compose Setup Guide](https://docs.exosphere.host/docker-compose-setup)** and **[Security Setup Guide](SECURITY_SETUP.md)**.
