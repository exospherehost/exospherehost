# Trigger Graph

Once you have created a graph template, you can trigger its execution by sending trigger states to the state manager. This guide shows you how to trigger graphs and monitor their execution.

> **ðŸ“š Getting Started**: For a complete local setup guide covering both the state manager and dashboard, see our [Local Setup Guide](./local-setup.md).

The recommended way to trigger graphs is using the Exosphere Python SDK, which provides a clean interface to the State Manager API.

=== "Exosphere Python SDK"

    ```python
    from exospherehost import StateManager, TriggerState

    async def trigger_graph():
        # Initialize state manager
        state_manager = StateManager(
            namespace="MyProject",
            state_manager_uri=EXOSPHERE_STATE_MANAGER_URI,
            key=EXOSPHERE_API_KEY
        )
               
        try:
            # Trigger the graph with optional store (beta)
            result = await state_manager.trigger(
                "my-graph",
                inputs={"user_id": "123"},
                store={"cursor": "0"}  # persisted across nodes (beta)
            )
            print(f"Graph triggered successfully!")
            print(f"Run ID: {result['run_id']}")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error triggering graph: {e}")
            raise

    # Run the function
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(trigger_graph())
    ```

## Monitoring on Exosphere Dashboard

The Exosphere dashboard provides a powerful web-based interface for monitoring your graphs in real-time.

For more details on using the Exosphere dashboard see the **[Dashboard Guide](./dashboard.md)**.
