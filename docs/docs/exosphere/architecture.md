# Exosphere Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Exosphere's top-level architecture, focusing on state execution, fanout mechanisms, and the unites keyword for stage unification.

> **ðŸ“š Getting Started**: For a complete local setup guide covering both the state manager and dashboard, see our [Local Setup Guide](./local-setup.md).

## Overview

Exosphere is built around a **state-based execution model** where workflows are composed of discrete states that can be executed independently. The architecture consists of several key components:

- **State Manager**: Central orchestrator that manages state lifecycle and transitions
- **Runtimes**: Distributed execution engines that process individual states
- **Graph Templates**: Declarative workflow definitions
- **States**: Individual execution units with inputs, outputs, and metadata

> **ðŸ“š Core Concepts**: For a comprehensive overview of Exosphere's unique features, see **[Exosphere Concepts](./concepts.md)**.

## State Execution Model

### State Lifecycle

Each state in Exosphere follows a well-defined lifecycle:

```
CREATED â†’ QUEUED â†’ EXECUTED/ERRORED â†’ SUCCESS
```

1. **CREATED**: State is initialized with inputs and dependencies
2. **QUEUED**: State is ready for execution and waiting for a runtime
3. **EXECUTED**: State finished (with outputs) â€” terminal for that state
4. **ERRORED**: State failed during executionState and all its dependencies are complete
5. **SUCCESS**: Workflow/branch-level success once all dependent states complete

### State Execution Flow

The following diagram illustrates how states flow through the execution system using the actual StateStatusEnum values:

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CREATED : Graph Triggered and Depencies Met
    
    CREATED --> QUEUED : Runtime picked task
    
    QUEUED --> EXECUTED : Runtime Executes
    QUEUED --> ERRORED : Runtime Fails
    QUEUED --> PRUNED : State pruned
    
    EXECUTED --> SUCCESS : Executed and children created
    EXECUTED --> NEXT_CREATED_ERROR : Error on creating next state
    
    ERRORED --> RETRY_CREATED : Retry Policy Allows  


```

### Runtime Interaction

States interact with runtimes through a pull-based model:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram   
    participant RT as Runtime
    participant SM as State Manager
    participant DB as Database
    
    RT->>SM: Request available states
    SM->>DB: Query queued states
    DB->>SM: Return eligible states
    SM->>RT: Assign state for execution
    RT->>RT: Execute state logic
    RT->>SM: Report completion/failure
    SM->>DB: Update state status
    SM->>DB: Store outputs/errors
    SM->>DB: Trigger dependent states
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more runtime instances to handle increased load
- **Parallel processing**: Fanout enables concurrent execution
- **Load distribution**: State manager distributes work across available runtimes

### Fault Tolerance

- **State persistence**: All states are stored in the database
- **Retry mechanisms**: Failed states can be retried automatically
- **Recovery**: Workflows can resume from where they left off

### Flexibility

- **Dynamic fanout**: Nodes can produce variable numbers of outputs
- **Synchronization**: Unites keyword provides precise control over parallel execution
- **Dependency management**: Automatic resolution of complex dependencies

### Observability

- **State tracking**: Complete visibility into execution progress
- **Error handling**: Detailed error information and retry logic
- **Performance monitoring**: Track execution times and resource usage


Exosphere's architecture provides a robust foundation for building distributed, scalable workflows. The combination of state-based execution, fanout mechanisms, and the unites keyword enables complex parallel processing patterns while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
