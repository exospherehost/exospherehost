# Exosphere Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Exosphere's top-level architecture, focusing on state execution, fanout mechanisms, and the unites keyword for stage unification.

## Overview

Exosphere is built around a **state-based execution model** where workflows are composed of discrete states that can be executed independently. The architecture consists of several key components:

- **State Manager**: Central orchestrator that manages state lifecycle and transitions
- **Runtimes**: Distributed execution engines that process individual states
- **Graph Templates**: Declarative workflow definitions
- **States**: Individual execution units with inputs, outputs, and metadata

## State Execution Model

### State Lifecycle

Each state in Exosphere follows a well-defined lifecycle:

```
CREATED → QUEUED → EXECUTED/ERRORED → SUCCESS
```

1. **CREATED**: State is initialized with inputs and dependencies
2. **QUEUED**: State is ready for execution and waiting for a runtime
3. **EXECUTED**: State completed successfully with outputs
4. **ERRORED**: State failed during execution
5. **SUCCESS**: State and all its dependencies are complete


## Fanout Mechanism

### Single vs Multiple Outputs

Exosphere supports two execution patterns:

1. **Single Output**: A state produces one output and continues to the next stage
2. **Multiple Outputs (Fanout)**: A state produces multiple outputs, creating parallel execution paths


### Fanout Example

Consider a data processing workflow:

```python hl_lines="9-11"
class DataSplitterNode(BaseNode):
    async def execute(self) -> list[Outputs]:
        data = json.loads(self.inputs.data)
        chunk_size = 100
        
        outputs = []
        for i in range(0, len(data), chunk_size):
            chunk = data[i:i + chunk_size]
            outputs.append(self.Outputs(
                chunk=json.dumps(chunk)
            ))
        
        return outputs  # This creates fanout on each output
```

When this node executes:
1. **Original state** gets the first chunk as output
2. **Additional states** are created for each remaining chunk
3. **All states** are marked as EXECUTED
4. **Next stages** are created for each state independently

**This enables parallel processing of data chunks across multiple runtime instances.**

## Unites Keyword

### Purpose

The `unites` keyword is a powerful mechanism for **synchronizing parallel execution paths**. It allows a node to wait for multiple parallel states to complete before executing.

### Unites Logic

When a node has a `unites` configuration:

1. **Execution is deferred** until all states with the specified identifier are complete
2. **State fingerprinting** ensures only one unites state is created per unique combination
3. **Dependency validation** ensures the unites node depends on the specified identifier

### Unites Example

```json hl_lines="22-24"
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_name": "DataSplitterNode",
      "identifier": "data_splitter",
      "next_nodes": ["processor_1"]
    },
    {
      "node_name": "DataProcessorNode",
      "identifier": "processor_1",
      "inputs":{
        "x":"${{data_splitter.outputs.data_chunk}}"
      }
      "next_nodes": ["result_merger"]
    },    
    {
      "node_name": "ResultMergerNode",
      "identifier": "result_merger",
      "inputs":{
        "x_processed":"${{processor_1.outputs.processed_data}}"
      }
      "unites": {
        "identifier": "data_splitter"
      },
      "next_nodes": []
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. `data_splitter` creates fanout with 3 outputs
2. `processor_1` executes in parallel for all three data chunks
3. `result_merger` waits for all processors to complete (unites with `data_splitter`)
4. Only one `result_merger` state is created due to fingerprinting

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more runtime instances to handle increased load
- **Parallel processing**: Fanout enables concurrent execution
- **Load distribution**: State manager distributes work across available runtimes

### Fault Tolerance

- **State persistence**: All states are stored in the database
- **Retry mechanisms**: Failed states can be retried automatically
- **Recovery**: Workflows can resume from where they left off

### Flexibility

- **Dynamic fanout**: Nodes can produce variable numbers of outputs
- **Synchronization**: Unites keyword provides precise control over parallel execution
- **Dependency management**: Automatic resolution of complex dependencies

### Observability

- **State tracking**: Complete visibility into execution progress
- **Error handling**: Detailed error information and retry logic
- **Performance monitoring**: Track execution times and resource usage


Exosphere's architecture provides a robust foundation for building distributed, scalable workflows. The combination of state-based execution, fanout mechanisms, and the unites keyword enables complex parallel processing patterns while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
